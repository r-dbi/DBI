# Get connection arguments

Returns the arguments stored in a
[DBIConnector](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/dev/reference/DBIConnector-class.md)
object for inspection, optionally evaluating them. This function is
called by
[`dbConnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/dev/reference/dbConnect.md) and
usually does not need to be called directly.

## Usage

``` r
dbGetConnectArgs(drv, eval = TRUE, ...)
```

## Arguments

- drv:

  A object inheriting from
  [DBIConnector](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/dev/reference/DBIConnector-class.md).

- eval:

  Set to `FALSE` to return the functions that generate the argument
  instead of evaluating them.

- ...:

  Other arguments passed on to methods. Not otherwise used.
