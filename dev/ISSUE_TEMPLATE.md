Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you
have a question, please don’t use this form. Instead, ask on
<https://stackoverflow.com/> or <https://community.rstudio.com/>.

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you’ve
never heard of a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start
by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

IMPORTANT: If your code requires accessing a specific database (with
e.g. `odbc`, `RSQLite`, `RJDBC`), the issue you are experiencing is
likely not a problem with the `DBI` package. Please file an issue with
the appropriate DBI backend instead.
