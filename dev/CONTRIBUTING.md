# Contributing to DBI

This outlines how to propose a change to DBI.

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited
directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made
in the *source* file.

- YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
- NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an
issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If
you’ve found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug
with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

- We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request
  (PR).  
- Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making
  changes. The `README` should contain badges for any continuous
  integration services used by the package.  
- We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
  [Markdown
  syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html),
  for documentation.  
- We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat).
  Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  
- Please do not update `NEWS.md`.
