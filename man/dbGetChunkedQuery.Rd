\title{Fetch data in chunks and access it with a callback}
\usage{
dbGetChunkedQuery(conn, statement, n, callback, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{A \code{\linkS4class{DBIConnection}} object, as produced by
\code{\link{dbConnect}}.}

\item{statement}{A character vector of length 1 containing SQL.}

\item{n}{The number of rows to fetch in each chunk.}

\item{callback}{A callback function whose only argument must be
the (partial) result set returned by the \code{statement} (dataframe).}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed on to methods.}
}
\value{
The last chunk of data fetched.
}
\description{
This function allows you to fetch data in chunks of \code{n}
rows at a time and acess that chunk using a callback. This is
meant as a safer and more efficient alternative to
\code{\link{dbSendQuery}}. On one hand, it does not keep the
result set open, so you don't have to worry about
\code{\link{dbClearResult}}. On the other hand, you never need
to have all of the data on your machine at once (each chunk
comes and goes), but you can still produce global results.
}
\details{
For most use cases, you will want to actually loop through all
of the data. But there are some cases for which this is not true
(for example, if you just want to locate a particular row). In
these situations, you can stop the function from continuing to
execute once your terminating condition is met. To do so, use:
\code{if (terminatingCondition) return(dbBreak)}. \code{dbBreak}
is a sentinel value that \code{DBI} recognizes and knows how
to interpret correctly.
}
\examples{
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
dbWriteTable(con, "cars", cars)

## Want to loop through all chunks to produce a global result
distSum <- 0
rowCount <- 0

dbGetChunkedQuery(con, "SELECT dist FROM cars", 10, function(df) {
  distSum <<- distSum + sum(df$dist)
  rowCount <<- rowCount + nrow(df)
})

(distAvg <- distSum / rowCount)

## Want to stop once we find the row we're looking for
rowCount <- 0

dbGetChunkedQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM cars", 1, function(df) {
  rowCount <<- rowCount + nrow(df)
  if (df$speed == 19 && df$dist == 46) {
    print(paste("Your row is number", rowCount))
    return(dbBreak)
  }
})

dbDisconnect(con)
}
