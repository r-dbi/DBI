\title{DBI: R Database Interface}
\description{
DBI defines an interface for communication between R and relational database
management systems.
All classes in this package are virtual and need to be extended by
the various R/DBMS implementations (so-called \emph{DBI backends}).
}
\section{Definition}{


A DBI backend is an R package
which imports the \pkg{DBI}
and \pkg{methods}
packages.
For better or worse, the names of many existing backends start with
\sQuote{R}, e.g., \pkg{RSQLite}, \pkg{RMySQL}, \pkg{RSQLServer}; it is up
to the backend author to adopt this convention or not.

}

\section{DBI classes and methods}{


A backend defines three classes,
which are subclasses of
\linkS4class{DBIDriver},
\linkS4class{DBIConnection},
and \linkS4class{DBIResult}.
The backend provides implementation for all methods
of these base classes
that are defined but not implemented by DBI.
All methods defined in \pkg{DBI} are reexported (so that the package can
be used without having to attach \pkg{DBI}),
and have an ellipsis \code{...} in their formals for extensibility.

}

\section{Construction of the DBIDriver object}{


The backend must support creation of an instance of its \linkS4class{DBIDriver}
subclass
with a \dfn{constructor function}.
By default, its name is the package name without the leading \sQuote{R}
(if it exists), e.g., \code{SQLite} for the \pkg{RSQLite} package.
However, backend authors may choose a different name.
The constructor must be exported, and
it must be a function
that is callable without arguments.
DBI recommends to define a constructor with an empty argument list.
